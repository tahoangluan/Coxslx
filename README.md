Coxlsx ist written using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) v5 and [Xlsx](https://sheetjs.com/).
This repo has two main purposes:
* Generate shareable `css` and `js` assets for use by others

## Usage
```html
required : Bootstrap, JQuery, Nodejs, font-awesome
```
First at all, After installing you have to import it to your projekt. For Example:
```html
<script type="module" src="/node_modules/coxlsx/src/coxlsx.js" >
  import {...} from "path/To/coxlsx.js"
</script
```
  
To render your file to table or visualize it to graphs you have to create a div container in which you want to visualize your data. Something like this:
```html
<div id="divId" ></div>
```
After that, in your own js your have to write just one line 
```html
render(fileUrl,divId)
```
## Example
For the data here:
https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Abortion-statistics/Abortion-statistics-Year-ended-December-2018/Download-data/abortion-statistics-year-ended-december-2018-abortions-by-age-of-woman-csv.csv
Firstly import coxlsx:
```html
<script type="module" src="/node_modules/coxlsx/src/coxlsx.js" >
  import {render} from "path/To/coxlsx.js"
</script>
```
And then define your div
```html
<div id="divId" ></div>
```
After that render the data with url
```html
    render("https://www.stats.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Abortion-statistics/Abortion-statistics-Year-ended-December-2018/Download-data/abortion-statistics-year-ended-december-2018-abortions-by-age-of-woman-csv.csv","divId")
```
